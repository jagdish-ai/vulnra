    body: `VULNRA ("we", "us", "our") is an AI vulnerability scanning platform. This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect when you use vulnra.ai and our API, how we process it, and the rights available to you.

This policy applies to all users globally and is designed to meet the requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 (DPDP Act), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). If you have questions, contact us at privacy@vulnra.ai.`,

    num: "02",
    title: "Data We Collect",
    body: `Account data: email address, hashed password, OAuth provider ID (GitHub or Google). We never store plain-text passwords.

Scan data: LLM API endpoint URLs you submit for scanning, probe results, risk scores, and AI Judge outputs. This data is stored in Supabase PostgreSQL and linked to your account.

API keys: we store only the SHA-256 hash of your vk_live_ API keys, not the keys themselves. The full key is shown once at creation time.

Usage and telemetry: scan counts, scan timestamps, tier information, and rate-limit counters stored in Redis and Supabase for quota enforcement.

Billing data: subscription tier, Lemon Squeezy customer ID and subscription ID. We do not store payment card details — these are handled entirely by Lemon Squeezy.

Log data: HTTP request logs (IP address, user agent, request path, timestamp) retained for up to 90 days for security monitoring and debugging.`,

    title: "How We Use Your Data",
    body: `Service delivery: to authenticate you, execute scans, store and retrieve your results, and generate PDF compliance reports.

Security and fraud prevention: to detect abuse, enforce usage quotas, investigate suspected unauthorized scanning, and protect the integrity of the platform.

Billing: to validate your subscription tier, process payments via Lemon Squeezy, and send billing-related emails.

Communications: to send transactional emails (email confirmation, password reset, Sentinel alerts) via Resend. We do not send marketing emails without your explicit opt-in.

Platform improvement: aggregate, anonymised scan statistics to improve probe coverage and detection accuracy. We never use individual scan data to train external models.`,

Legal obligation (Art. 6(1)(c)): retaining billing records as required by applicable tax and accounting laws.
